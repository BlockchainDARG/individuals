What is DOACC?
============== 

It’s an altcoin catalogue
-------------------------

DOACC is a catalogue of published facts about altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin): name, trading symbol, total coins, block target time, hashing algorithm, date launched, URL of the source code repository, etc.

It’s a part of the semantic web
-------------------------------

The catalogue of facts is published using semantic web technology: RDF and OWL. This approach takes advantage of the attendant power and flexibility of representation in order to improve ease of re-use.
 
Why DOACC?
========== 

For the broadest view
---------------------

DOACC has recorded facts for over 2200 altcoins along with details of the different protocols used, different hashing algorithms, distribution schemes, protection schemes, etc.

For the most powerful view
--------------------------

The DOACC catalogue is based on two complementary ontologies (DOACC and CCY), knowledge representations that formally describe the facts in the catalogue and enable inferences to be drawn from those facts.
